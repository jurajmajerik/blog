We'll be using the Go language for the backend code. Here I'll show how to install Go on the server (Linux) and a local machine (macOS).

## Linux (server)
The Go package can be downloaded from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install). On the server, I can get the package with a ```wget``` command, passing it the download link as an argument:
```
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.2.linux-amd64.pkg
```

Then I can follow the steps from the Go website. The ```/usr``` folder is protected, so we need to prefix any commands that target it with a ```sudo```.

The first step is to check if there's any previous Go installation.
```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

Next, unpack the Go package with the ```tar``` command:
```
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Go is now installed; we just need to add it to our ```PATH```. ```PATH``` is a special variable that tells the system where the executable files are located. Whenever we type the ```go``` command, the system will know to run to the ```/usr/local/go/bin``` file. We can update the ```PATH``` in the ```~/.profile``` file:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Now let's log out of the server and log back in for the ```PATH``` changes to take effect. Another option is to just run the ```.profile``` script manually. Once we're done, we can check the installation.
```
juraj@server:~$ go version
go version go1.19.2 linux/amd64
```

We can now run Go programs on our server.

## macOS (local machine)
Installing Go on our local macOS is much simpler. Just download the ```.pkg``` file from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install) and install it. Then check the installation with ```go version```.
